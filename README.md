### Approach Taken
First I structured my data inside the firebase console. I then started building out the layout of the app starting with the navigation. I added a landing page that navigates to a login or signup page. The signup page navigates to the login page when you submit a new user. The login page navigates to the dashboard of the app which has a tab navigator with the main dashboard that is empty as of now and a profile page where you can add images and delete images.

### Things to improve on/ add
I would like to connect each user to their specific data so that the data on the profile page is user specific. I would like to then add the dashboard page that loops through all of the users images and displays them along with their username. I would like the sign out to function properly.
